Title: Face Mask Detection using TensorFlow and OpenCV

Introduction:

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, face mask detection has become a crucial technology to ensure public safety. This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a face mask detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create a simple yet effective model for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

Requirements:

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

TensorFlow: Install the TensorFlow library using pip install tensorflow.
OpenCV: Install the OpenCV library using pip install opencv-python.
Python: Make sure you have a working Python environment.
Building the Face Mask Detection Model:

Step 1: Dataset Collection

To train a face mask detection model, you'll need a dataset containing images of people with and without masks. You can either create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets.

Step 2: Model Training

For simplicity, we'll use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for our face mask detection task. TensorFlow provides the TensorFlow Hub library, which allows us to easily use pre-trained models.
